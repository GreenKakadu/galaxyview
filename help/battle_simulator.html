<p>The Battle Simulator calculates the odds that a particular battle will be won or lost.  There are several ways to assign ships to attacker or defender groups.  (Note that there may be more than one nation involved in a battle, and in fact the Battle Simulator will allow you to put ships from a single nation on opposite sides of a battle, but the Battle Simulator assumes that all attacker groups are at war with all defender groups.)  After ships are assigned to attacker and defender groups, the battle is simulated a set number of times (default 100 simulations) and the results are displayed in totals and percentages of battles won, lost or drawn.</p>

<p>Attacker and defender groups are displayed in tables identical to those used in the <a href="groups_tbl.html"><img src="../resource/buttons/groups_tbl.png" width="20" height="20" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" alt="Groups Table button"></a> <a href="groups_tbl.html">Groups Table</a>.
