	<h1>GalaxyView Project Plan</h1>
	<h1>Purpose</h1>
	<p>
	  This project is designed to implement the functionality of the
	  existing GalaxyView turn viewer. The current turn viewer is
	  written in Delphi and is a Microsoft Windows only product
	  (although it is usable to a large extent under Wine on Linux.)
	</p>
	<p>
	  There are several goals set out in accomplishing the completion
	  of this project:
	  <ul>
		<li>Fix outstanding bugs</li>
		<li>Provide native applications on multiple platforms (at a
		  minimum Windows and Linux)</li>
		<li>Switch to XML reports to facilitate being usable with
		  different Galaxy variants</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	
	<h1>Tools</h1>
	<h2>wxWindows</h2>
	<p>
	  After searching the web for cross-platform GUI tools there were
	  only two that were found that were really usable: <a
		href="http://objectcentral.com/">v-gui</a>  and <a
		href="http://wxWindows.org">wxWindows</a>
	</p>
	<p>
	  wxWindows was chosen for one main reason: it has a native look and
	  feel for the platforms it runs on. v-gui, while a good toolkit,
	  has its own look and feel on every platform.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Other reasons to like wxWindows is that it has an active
	  developer community, the developers respond quickly to questions
	  and concerns, they are continually improving the library, and
	  they actively support open source, both in principle and
	  inactuality.
	</p>
	<h1>User Interface</h1>
	<h2>Appearance</h2>
	<h3>Panes</h3>
	<p>
	  The application will present itself as a single top-level window
	  with 3 panes. The panes will be adjustable in size, but it will
	  not be possible to completely eliminate any of the panes,
	  although its minimized size will be very small. The default
	  application size will be the smaller of 1024x768 or the maximum
	  size of the window. Due to the amount of data to be presented,
	  application sizes less than 800x600 will have greatly reduced
	  usability. 
	</p>
	<h4>Map</h4>
	<p>
	  The upper right pane will initially be approximately 1/4 of the
	  window size. This pane is used to graphically display the state
	  of the game for all elements that have graphical aspects.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Originally the map pane should show the entire map, scaled to
	  fit the avaliable pane size. Any existing bookmarks will
	  override this default behaviour. There are 5 ways to cause the
	  map to be redrawn to a different scale. One way changes the
	  pane size - this is done by dragging the resize bars or changing
	  the size of the application window. The map should be redrawn
	  with the same extents, but rescaled to fit the available space. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  The other changes are done with tool interactions. There are 3
	  tools available through the menu - the zoom+ and zoom- which
	  change the viewable area of the map by 10% of the map size, with
	  a minimum size of 10% and a maximum size of 300%. This zooming
	  is done about the current center of the map.
	</p>
	<p>
	  There are several decorations that can be added to a map. These
	  are available from the menu in addition to a popup menu when the
	  map is right-clicked on. These decorations include: relative
	  planet size, production, .....
	</p>
	<p>
	  There is a zoom here function which will zoom in on a left click
	  and zoom out on a right click, but the center of the map changes
	  to be the point that was clicked on.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The last method of changing the displayed map is to click on the
	  map and drag out a square - this becomes the displayed area of
	  the map. In the case of a rectangular area being selected, a
	  square area will be shown with the size of the square being the
	  size of the largest side of the rectangle.
	</p>
	<h4>Tools</h4>
	<p>
	  The remainder of the upper 1/2 of the application will be used
	  for tools. This pane will consist of a tabbed notebook with each
	  tool appearing on its own tab. Tools will be written as a
	  plug-in. This allows us to more easily support different game
	  variants as well as provide bug fixes without having to
	  distribute the entire application.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Investigation is under way to add the ability to implement a
	  scripting language. If this option is incorporated, then the
	  scripting language used will be one of the languages that also
	  has a wxWindows interface. This will allow us to prototype
	  features and recode them for speed (if necessary.) It also
	  allows for extensibility of the viewer, to implement features
	  that we haven't yet thought of or for specialized, user-specific
	  needs.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In addition, tools will be implimented via a plugin
	  architecture. Each tool will be derived from the GVToolPlugin
	  class. <br />
		<pre>
		  <code>
			class GVToolPlugin {
			  public:
			    GVToolPlugin(wxPanel* panel);
			    wxString& GetName(void) = 0;
			    void Redraw(void) = 0;
			    void Run(void) = 0;
			}
		  </code>
		</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
	  Tools will follow a naming convention in order to allow for
	  controlling the order of loading of the plugins. This convention
	  will be PXXXname. P is for plugin, XXX is a 3 digit number which
	  will be for ordering, and name can be any name appropriate for
	  the functionality. Unless there is a need for tightly coupling 
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Message Center</b> The Message Center is used for sending and
	  receiving both personal and global messages. There may be added
	  functionality to use this panel for emailing (or otherwise
	  contacting the server to send) orders to the server.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Move Editor</b> The Move Editor is the main interface for the
	  user to create turn orders. This pane will have a list of valid
	  orders to choose from, the ability to see orders either in short
	  or extended form, the ability to set the player's race name,
	  password, and real name, and orders email address. In addition
	  there will be buttons to verify orders, auto-generate planet
	  building, (what else?) 
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Planet Editor</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Ship Designer</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Battle Simulator</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Treaty Editor</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Intelligence</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Text Editor</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Calculator</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Production</b> The production tool shows a players planets
	  and what is being produced on it. This information is also
	  available on the Planets table, but it's here in a more concise
	  manner. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Stockpiles</b> This tool is used much like the production
	  tool in that it shows planets and their stockpiles for ease of
	  use for the player.
	</p>
	<h4>Tabular data</h4>
	<p>
	  The bottom 1/2 of the application will be used for tabular data
	  (tabular in the meaning of a grid layout.) Each table will have
	  it's own tab across the top (configurable?).
	</p>
	<p>
	  As with tools, tables will be generated by plugins. A common
	  interface for tables will be that left clicking on a table
	  header will sort the table by that column in ascending
	  order. Right clicking on the header will sort in descending
	  order. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  Tables will also use a color code to show the validity of data
	  by varying the background color of the row. Green indicates data
	  taken directly from the turn report. Yellow indicates data
	  entered by the user, and red is data gathered from turn report
	  slices given by other places.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Groups</b> This table will also have a dropdown box to allow
	  the user to select which race they wish to show information
	  about. One of the choices should be "All Races". Columns for
	  this table will be, at a minimum, Group number, ship type,
	  number of ships, drive, attack, weapons, shields, cargo,
	  location, destination, Race.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Clicking on a group in the table will locate that group on the
	  map.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Fleets</b> Very similiar to groups, but with fleet
	  information instead.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Clicking on a fleet in the table will locate that fleet on the
	  map.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Incoming Groups</b> This will give a list of the groups that
	  are incoming to a planet you own. Columns will be: destination,
	  probable source, distance remaining.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Ship Types</b> This table is to show a player all of their
	  ship designs. There will be a drop-down box that will also show
	  other Races that the player has seen so that any of their ship
	  designs can be shown.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Planets</b> This table will show the player all of their
	  planets with the following information: number, name, size,
	  resources, x, y, population, industry, capital, material,
	  colonists, production, posture, and status.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Routes</b> This table will show the player all the routes
	  between their planets. Clicking on a planet in the table will
	  show the routes on the map.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Races</b> This table shows the player all of the races that
	  they know about, along with information that is known about
	  them. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Battles</b> This table will show all battles that the player
	  was involved in. It will have -- is this a good fit for a table?
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Bombings</b> This will show the player which planets they
	  lost and which they gained, along with who did the bombing and
	  what the value is of the planet they've gained.
	</p>
	<h4>Menu</h4>
	<p>
	  The application will have a standard tool bar, the layout of
	  which can be found <a
		href="http://galaxyview.sourceforge.net/help/">here</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Whenever possible, menu selections will activate the appropriate
	  tool or table and take the user there.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The appliation will also have a standard status bar across the
	  bottom.
	</p>
	<h1>Directory Structure</h1>
	<h2>Startup files</h2>
	<p>
	  The location of startup files will be platform dependent and be
	  in line with normal program conventions for that platform.
	</p>
	<p><b>Linux</b> A directory named .galaxyview will be created in
	  the user's home directory.
	</p>
	<p><b>Microsoft Windows</b> A folder named GalaxyView will be
	  created in the <code>Program Files</code> folder.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The directory structure under this starting point should be the
	  same on all platforms.<br />
		<pre>
		  <code>

	</p>
	<p>
	  The <code>tools</code>, <code>tables</code>, and
	  <code>map</code> directories are for plugins. There are
	  subdirectories for supported game types. A plugin is a shared
	  library that implements a particular set of interfaces.
