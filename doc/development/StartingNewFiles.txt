		 Starting new source and header files


In the main directory you'll find two files, template.h and
template.cpp. These are meant to be used when creating new class files
so that all of them have the proper copyright notice, etc.

After you've copied the template to the class name, edit each one and
do a couple of text substitutions:

ClassName.h

    1) substitute the string HEADERNAME with the class name in all
       caps. s/HEADERNAME/CLASSNAME/

    2) substitute the string HeaderName with the class name properly
       capitalized. s/HeaderName/ClassName/

    3) substitute the string USED_FOR with a short 3 or 4 word phrase
       describing the purpose of this header. 
       s/USED_FOR/class purpose/

    4) delete the line  "// definitions go here" and start coding

ClassName.cpp

    1) substitute the string SrcName with the class name properly
       capitalized. s/SrcName/ClassName/

    2) substitute the string USED_FOR with a short 3 or 4 word phrase
       describing the purpose of this class.
       s/USED_FOR/class purpose/

    3) go to the bottom of the file and start coding


One of the features of the .cpp template is that you'll automatically
get the include for the class header. If this doesn't happen to be a
class file then you can just delete that line.
