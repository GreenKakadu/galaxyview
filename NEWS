GalaxyView as currently distributed is version 2.85 and was developed
by Roland Schulz. In February of 2003 he put the code under the GPL 
and I started "maintaining" it.

A principal desire of mine is to have a native Linux client (the current
client can run under Wine once you get the expanded archive from someone
else - the current self extracting archive won't work under wine.)

Since the original was written under Borland's Delphi, I first attempted
to use Kylix to compile for Linux. The problem is that there is a lot of
code that is Windows specific and coding around that in addition to 
maintaining multiple versions of forms pretty much ruled out further 
development in the original pascal.

The intent of the new, Version 3 GalaxyView is to use wxWindows and
MetaKit as the basis for a platform independent client that will 
maintain the original functionality of GalaxyView, fix bugs that still 
existed (not too many), and add new functionality.
